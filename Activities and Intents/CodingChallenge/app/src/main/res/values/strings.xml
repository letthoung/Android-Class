    <string name="passage2">TEXT TWO: Yes it can.
        With so many things to remember-appointments, passwords, birthdays,
        anniversaries, phone numbers-the list goes on and on- one can wonder
        if our brains can handle one more thing to remember.
        The truth is God is so good to us,
        He created the human brain with an unlimited storage capacity.
